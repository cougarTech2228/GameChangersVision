# 2228 - CugarTech Galactic Search Neural Network

## Prerequisits

The following software must be installed prior to being able to run the jupyter notebook:

- Python 3.7.x or higher. Note, this was tested with 3.7, and might work with newer versions, but python has a tendency  to not play well with different versions YMMV.

## Running

Simply run the launch_notebook.bat (Windows) or launch_notebook.sh (Mac/Linux).
This script will configure a python virtual environment, and install all the required packages. Note, this may take a while the very first time you run this, as some of the neural network libraries are rather large.

See the documentation in the Jupyter notebook itself for details about actually running the training.
